# twitch CLI client

Comtains bad code, I might make it better if there is any interest (contact me leprosy93@gmail.com)

Depends on Firefox and Streamlink (can easily be avoided)

index.php is start point

You should create config.php with params listed in index.php

You should have a script echoing request in JSON on your callback url

If you want automatic oAuth, you should create cookies.txt with your twitch cookies
